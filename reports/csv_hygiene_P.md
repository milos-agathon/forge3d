- P1: High ✓
- P2: High ✓
- P3: Medium ✓
- P4: Medium ✓

**Allowed values:** High, Medium, Low  
**Out-of-vocabulary:** 0 instances

### Phase Field Compliance
✅ **All Phase values valid:**
- P1: Beyond MVP ✓
- P2: Beyond MVP ✓
- P3: Beyond MVP ✓
- P4: Beyond MVP ✓

**Allowed values:** MVP, Beyond MVP  
**Out-of-vocabulary:** 0 instances

### Required Fields Presence
✅ **All required fields present:**

| Task ID | Task Title | Deliverables | Acceptance Criteria |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| P1 | ✓ Present | ✓ Present | ✓ Present |
| P2 | ✓ Present | ✓ Present | ✓ Present |
| P3 | ✓ Present | ✓ Present | ✓ Present |
| P4 | ✓ Present | ✓ Present | ✓ Present |

**Missing required fields:** 0 instances

### Optional Fields Analysis

#### Missing Features Field
- P1: "No" (indicates task should be implementable)
- P2: "No" (indicates task should be implementable)
- P3: "No" (indicates task should be implementable)
- P4: "No" (indicates task should be implementable)

#### Dependencies Field
- P1: "G1,C8" (valid task IDs)
- P2: "M2,O2" (valid task IDs)
- P3: "G4,P1" (valid task IDs, includes self-reference to P1)
- P4: "P1,F3" (valid task IDs, includes self-reference to P1)

## Data Quality Observations

### Semicolon Usage
✅ **Proper semicolon usage within cells:**
- Semicolons used as list separators within Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria
- No column splitting by semicolons detected
- Consistent with CSV conventions specified in task.xml

### Cell Content Quality
✅ **Well-formed content:**
- All cells contain meaningful text (no placeholder values)
- Markdown formatting (backticks) used appropriately in some cells
- No truncated or corrupted data detected

### Trailing Column
✅ **Unnamed: 12 column is empty as expected**
- All rows have empty values in column 12
- Safe to ignore per CSV schema specification

## Cross-Reference Validation

### Dependency Consistency
✅ **All referenced dependencies exist in roadmap:**
- G1: ✓ Exists (Synthetic DEM goldens)
- C8: ✓ Exists (Linear→tonemap→sRGB pipeline)
- M2: ✓ Exists (Memory budget tracker)
- O2: ✓ Exists (GPU memory pools)
- G4: ✓ Exists (GPU timestamp queries per pass)
- P1: ✓ Self-reference valid (Golden image framework)
- F3: ✓ Exists (CI workflow skeleton)

### Risk/Mitigation Alignment
✅ **All risks have corresponding mitigations:**
- P1: "Platform variance → per-backend baselines"
- P2: "False positives → proper cleanup between tests"
- P3: "Noisy CI → dedicated perf runners"
- P4: "Expensive infrastructure → cloud GPU services"

## Summary

**Overall CSV Hygiene Score: 100%**

✅ No anomalies detected  
✅ All validation rules passed  
✅ Data integrity maintained  
✅ Cross-references valid  

The Workstream P section of roadmap.csv demonstrates excellent data quality and consistency. All fields conform to the expected controlled vocabularies, required fields are complete, and dependencies are properly specified with valid task IDs.

## Recommendations

1. **No corrective action required** - The CSV data for Workstream P is clean and well-formed
2. **Best practice observed** - Clear risk/mitigation pairs provide good traceability
3. **Dependency management** - The self-referential dependencies (P3→P1, P4→P1) indicate proper task sequencing
