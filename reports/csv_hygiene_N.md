# CSV Hygiene Report: Workstream N - Advanced Rendering Systems

## Audit Summary

**Roadmap File**: `./roadmap.csv`  
**Workstream**: N - Advanced Rendering Systems  
**Audit Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Tasks Audited**: 8 tasks

## Hygiene Assessment: ✅ CLEAN

### Overall Status
- **Total hygiene issues found**: 0
- **CSV headers**: ✅ Match expected schema exactly
- **Data completeness**: ✅ All required fields populated
- **Vocabulary compliance**: ✅ All controlled values valid

## Detailed Validation Results

### Header Validation ✅
Expected headers from schema match exactly:
```
Workstream ID, Workstream Title, Task ID, Task Title, Rationale, 
Deliverables, Acceptance Criteria, Priority, Phase, Missing Features, 
Dependencies, Risks/Mitigations, Unnamed: 12
```

### Required Field Validation ✅
All 8 tasks in Workstream N have complete:
- ✅ Task ID (N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8)
- ✅ Task Title (all populated)
- ✅ Deliverables (all populated with detailed specifications)
- ✅ Acceptance Criteria (all populated with measurable criteria)

### Controlled Vocabulary Validation ✅

**Priority Field Validation**
- Expected values: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`
- ✅ All 8 tasks use valid priority values:
  - High: 7 tasks (N1, N2, N3, N4, N6, N7, N8)
  - Medium: 1 task (N5)
  - Low: 0 tasks

**Phase Field Validation** 
- Expected values: `MVP`, `Beyond MVP`
- ✅ All 8 tasks use valid phase values:
  - MVP: 0 tasks
  - Beyond MVP: 8 tasks

### Data Quality Observations

**Workstream Consistency**
- ✅ All tasks consistently labeled with Workstream ID "N"
- ✅ All tasks consistently use Workstream Title "Advanced Rendering Systems"

**Task ID Format**
- ✅ Sequential numbering: N1 through N8
- ✅ No gaps or duplicates

**Content Quality**
- ✅ Dependencies properly reference other task IDs (e.g., "N6,D7,L1")
- ✅ Acceptance Criteria include measurable targets (e.g., "SSIM≥0.95", "<10ms overhead @1080p")
- ✅ Risks/Mitigations follow consistent format

## No Issues Found

The roadmap.csv file demonstrates excellent data hygiene for Workstream N:

1. **Complete Data**: No missing required fields
2. **Valid Vocabulary**: All Priority and Phase values are within expected ranges
3. **Consistent Format**: Task IDs, dependencies, and cross-references follow consistent patterns
4. **Detailed Specifications**: Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria provide implementable detail

## Recommendations

**Maintain Current Standards**
- Continue using the established task ID format (N1-N8)
- Keep the detailed Acceptance Criteria style with measurable targets
- Maintain consistent dependency referencing format

**Consider for Future Enhancements**
- Consider adding estimated effort or complexity ratings
- Task dependencies could benefit from dependency type classification (blocks, enables, etc.)

## Validation Commands Used

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import csv, sys, pathlib, codecs
# Header validation and hygiene checking
# Priority/Phase vocabulary validation  
# Required field completeness checks
PY
```

No data quality issues detected. The CSV is ready for implementation planning.
