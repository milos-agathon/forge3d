Workstream Q — Verification & Gap Analysis

Summary

- Scope: Execute docs/task-gpt.txt audit plan, verify deliverables, run builds/tests/docs/demos, and report gaps.
- Result: Q1 and Q3 core deliverables present and tests pass; Q2 and Q5 scaffolds implemented; docs built; demo runs executed and artifacts written to reports/.

Audit Matrix

- Q1: Post-processing compute pipeline (effect chain)
  - Files: PRESENT — src/core/postfx.rs, src/core/async_compute.rs, src/core/tonemap.rs, python/forge3d/postfx.py, tests/test_postfx_chain.py, docs/postfx/index.md, examples/postfx_chain_demo.py
  - Tests: PASS — tests/test_postfx_chain.py
  - Acceptance: Python enable/disable/list present; demo executed; performance/golden image checks not measured.

- Q2: LOD system (impostors + transitions)
  - Files: PARTIAL — PRESENT: src/terrain/lod.rs, src/terrain/impostors.rs, shaders/impostor_atlas.wgsl, docs/terrain/lod.md, examples/lod_impostors_demo.py
  - Tests: PRESENT — tests/test_lod_perf.py
  - Acceptance: Demo executed; metrics recorded; visual transitions not verified.

- Q3: GPU profiling markers & timestamp queries
  - Files: PRESENT — src/core/gpu_timing.rs, src/core/hdr.rs, src/pipeline/hdr_offscreen.rs, src/vector/indirect.rs, python/forge3d/gpu_metrics.py, docs/production/gpu_profiling.md
  - Tests: PASS — tests/test_gpu_timestamps.py
  - Acceptance: Python surface returns metrics; overhead and external capture visibility not measured here.

- Q4: Indirect draw support (validation-only)
  - Files: PRESENT — src/vector/indirect.rs
  - Acceptance: Evidence of code path exists; a quick runtime smoke test not executed here.

- Q5: Bloom (bright-pass + separable blur + composite)
  - Files: PRESENT — shaders/bloom_brightpass.wgsl, shaders/bloom_blur_h.wgsl, shaders/bloom_blur_v.wgsl, examples/bloom_demo.py, docs/postfx/index.md
  - Tests: PRESENT — tests/test_postfx_bloom.py
  - Acceptance: Controls and perf estimate verified; compute path scaffolded; full composite pending.

Commands & Results

- Build
  - maturin develop --release — SUCCESS (installed forge3d-0.9.0)
  - cargo build --release — PARTIAL: bench/example targets error; library validated via Python builds/tests

- Tests
  - Full pytest: 502 passed, 86 skipped, 4 xfailed
  - Targeted: gpu_timestamps, postfx_chain, postfx_bloom, lod_perf — PASS

- Docs
  - docs build — SUCCESS (HTML in docs/_build/html)

- Demos
  - Executed: postfx_chain_demo.py, bloom_demo.py, lod_impostors_demo.py
  - Artifacts in reports/: postfx.png, bloom.png, q_lod_metrics.json

Gaps & Recommendations

- Q1: Consider adding golden image checks and SSIM; wire GPU timing into postfx stages.
- Q2: Implement full impostor atlas generation and transitions; add real scene sweep and metrics.
- Q5: Complete bright-pass → blur H/V → composite and integrate into Renderer chain; add GPU image parity tests.

Environment Notes

- Windows (win_amd64), network-restricted. GPU-dependent acceptance (fps, SSIM) not measured.
