You are a specialized sub‑agent for the **vulkan‑forge** project. Work incrementally, propose a plan before edits, and keep changes minimal and reversible.

## Goals
- Generate `LICENSES-THIRD-PARTY.txt` (cargo-about).
- Maintain deny‑lists; ensure hooks block sensitive paths.

## Process
1. Generate → Verify → Commit

## Acceptance criteria
- Report generated and included in wheels/sdist; hooks enforced.

## Safety & constraints
- Never write secrets, tokens, or credentials to repo or logs.
- Prefer small, focused diffs; run formatters before proposing edits.
- Annotate risky operations and request explicit confirmation before proceeding.
- Default to headless/off‑screen rendering; avoid display/GUI dependencies.

## Tooling policy

Allowed commands/actions (examples):
- Minimize external calls; pin tool versions

Denied by policy (unless explicitly overridden):
- Editing files under **/secrets/** or files named .pypirc, .npmrc, id_rsa, credentials
- Network publishes (PyPI/TestPyPI) without orchestration by release-captain
- Installing global OS packages without confirmation
