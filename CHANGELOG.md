  - `TerrainUniforms` struct (std140-compatible, **176 bytes**, 16-byte aligned).
  - `Globals` container and `TerrainSpike::debug_uniforms_f32()` to inspect 44-float UBO layout.
- Terrain camera integration:
  - `TerrainSpike::set_camera_look_at(...)` computes aspect from framebuffer and updates UBO.
  - Default projection switched to **WGPU clip space** via `camera::perspective_wgpu()`.

### Changed
- `build_view_matrices()` now uses WGPU depth range [0,1] (was GL [-1,1]).
- GL→WGPU depth conversion refactored to `gl_to_wgpu()` helper.

### Tests
- Rust: unit test guarantees `TerrainUniforms` size and alignment.
- Rust: unit test verifies default projection is WGPU clip space.
- Python: `tests/test_camera.py` (~20 tests) covering camera math, validation, and TerrainSpike integration.

### Docs
- README updated to document WGPU clip-space default and camera API examples.

## [0.0.6] - 2025-08-15
### Workstream T1 — CPU Mesh & GPU Resources
**Status:** Complete

### Added
- **CPU grid mesh generator**
  - New `terrain::mesh::{make_grid, GridMesh, GridVertex, Indices}` with CCW winding and centered origin.
  - Python API `_forge3d.grid_generate(nx, nz, spacing, origin)` returning NumPy arrays:
    - `XY: (N,2) float32`, `UV: (N,2) float32`, `indices: (M,) uint32`.
  - Validation of shapes/dtypes; zero-copy where possible.
- **Height texture upload (R32Float)**
  - `Renderer.upload_height_r32f()` with proper 256-byte `bytes_per_row` padding.
  - Debug helpers: `debug_read_height_patch()` and `read_full_height_texture()`.
- **Colormap LUT system**
  - Central registry `src/colormap/mod.rs` with embedded 256×1 PNG assets: `viridis`, `magma`, `terrain`.
  - Unconditional Python/Rust discovery: `colormap_supported()`.
  - Runtime texture format selection:
    - Prefer `Rgba8UnormSrgb`; fallback to `Rgba8Unorm` with CPU sRGB→linear conversion.
    - Env toggle `VF_FORCE_LUT_UNORM=1` to exercise fallback path.
  - `TerrainSpike` integration (feature-gated): bind group layout `(0=UBO, 1=texture, 2=sampler)`, linear-filtered LUT sampling.
  - `TerrainSpike.debug_lut_format()` for inspection.
- **Docs & API polish**
  - Expanded README sections (T11, T1.2, T1.3).
  - Rich docstrings in `python/forge3d/__init__.py`.

### Changed
- Removed stale `grid` module; Python keeps a `generate_grid` alias to the new `grid_generate` for compatibility.
- `TerrainSpike` now seeds lighting from the computed light vector.
- WGSL shader cleaned up and aligned with binding layout.

### Fixed
- WGSL parsing errors (commas vs semicolons) and linear-space lighting correctness.

### Tests
- `tests/test_grid_generate.py`: shapes, dtypes, UV corners, CCW winding, u16/u32 index switch, large grids.
- `tests/test_colormap.py`: registry/discovery, format fallback (including `VF_FORCE_LUT_UNORM`), shader sanity.

### Compatibility
- No breaking Python API changes; `TerrainSpike` remains feature-gated.
- Rust callers should migrate imports from `crate::grid` → `crate::terrain::mesh`.
  - Python alias preserves old name: `generate_grid = grid_generate`.


## \[0.0.5] - 2025-08-08

### Added

* **T33 – Colormap LUT & assets:** Embedded 256×1 PNG LUTs (`viridis`, `magma`, `terrain`) and a central registry `colormap.rs` exposing `SUPPORTED` and `resolve_bytes()`. LUTs are sampled in the fragment shader for height-mapped color.
* **A2 – Terrain spike renderer:** `TerrainSpike(width, height, grid=128, colormap='viridis')` headless renderer with off-screen target and `render_png(path)` for test coverage.
* **T2.2 – Sun direction & tonemap:** Uniforms now carry `sun_dir` and `exposure`; shader computes diffuse `N·L` and applies Reinhard tonemap for perceptually non-flat output. Python helpers `set_sun(elevation_deg, azimuth_deg)` and `set_exposure(exposure)` (gated by `terrain_spike` feature).
* **T1.1 – Grid index/vertex generator:** CPU grid mesh (positions + normals) for the spike terrain; Python wrapper `grid_generate(nx, nz, spacing=(dx,dy), origin='center')` returning NumPy arrays.

### Changed

* **Uniform layout:** `TerrainUniforms` repacked to std140-compatible **176 bytes**:
  `view(64) + proj(64) + sun_exposure(16) + spacing_h_exag_pad(16) + _pad_tail(16)`.
  Matches WGSL reflection and avoids validation errors.
* **Shader pipeline:** `terrain.wgsl` updated to consume the new uniform layout, sample the LUT, apply diffuse lighting, and tonemap; bindings: `@group(0) @binding(0)=UBO`, `1=LUT texture_2d`, `2=Sampler`.
* **Colormap selection:** Strict, case-sensitive names validated against `SUPPORTED`; shared error text across Rust/Python to keep tests deterministic.

### Fixed

* **wgpu validation panic** “buffer size 164, shader expects 176”: corrected by the new UBO layout.
* **WGSL parse error** (“expected ',', found ';'”): struct fields now comma-separated; shader module creation no longer fails.
* **wgpu 0.19 API mismatch**: `ImageDataLayout.{bytes_per_row,rows_per_image}` now `Option<u32>`—converted `NonZeroU32` via `.into()` at all call sites.
* **Colormap ‘magma’ rejected**: registry and asset mapping added; constructor accepts `"magma"`.
* **Uniform PNG output (\~710B)**: shader now maps height→LUT and lights scene; PNG sizes comfortably exceed the test threshold.

### Technical Notes

* Off-screen color target `Rgba8UnormSrgb` with 256-byte row alignment for copies; readback performs CPU unpadding.
* Validation layers remain enabled in Debug; any device/shader error is a test failure.
* Paths kept zero-copy for NumPy interop; no unnecessary heap churn during readbacks.

## [0.0.4] - 2025-08-05

- **A1.5 – Python API surface**: public package `forge3d` with:
  - `Renderer(width, height)`
  - `render_triangle_rgba(width, height) -> (H,W,4) uint8`
  - `render_triangle_png(path, width, height) -> None`
  - `__version__` metadata
- Legacy alias **`vshade`** re-exports the public API for compatibility.

### Changed
- PyO3 text signatures and docstrings for `__init__`, `render_triangle_rgba`, `render_triangle_png`, and `info`.
- Robust import in `forge3d/__init__.py` (supports top-level or package-internal `_forge3d`).

### Fixed
- Import symbol mismatch by standardizing the module to `#[pymodule] fn _forge3d(...)`.
- Deterministic pipeline preserved (blend=None, CLEAR_COLOR, CCW + back-cull, fixed viewport/scissor).

### Notes
- For Python 3.13 + PyO3 0.21, build with `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1`.
