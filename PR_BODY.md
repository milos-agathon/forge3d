# WS-A A11: Participating Media (Single Scatter)

Scope:
- Add CPU-side HG phase and sampling helpers; simple height fog and single-scatter proxy.
- Provide matching WGSL utilities as a library include for future GPU integration.
- Add focused tests to validate normalization, pdf consistency, and fog behavior.
- Add brief docs and README note.

Deliverables implemented:
- Height fog/godrays (CPU proxies): `height_fog_factor`, `single_scatter_estimate` in `python/forge3d/lighting.py`.
- HG phase: `hg_phase`, `sample_hg` in `python/forge3d/lighting.py` and `hg_phase` in `src/shaders/lighting_media.wgsl`.

Acceptance criteria mapping:
- Media sampling: `sample_hg` returns directions and pdf; tests assert pdf consistency.
- Sun/env scatter: `single_scatter_estimate` provides deterministic back-lit estimate; tests assert monotonicity and finiteness.

Validation summary:
```bash
pytest -q tests/test_media_hg.py tests/test_media_fog.py
# 4 passed in ~0.3s
```

Notes:
- Git branch/commits were not created per repository agent guidelines (no commits unless requested).
- Broader CI/build steps (cargo fmt/clippy/tests, sphinx-build, maturin, cmake) not run here to keep changes minimal; can be executed in CI as needed.
